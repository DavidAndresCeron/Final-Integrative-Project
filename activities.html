                <p>Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned park in Ontario is a sanctuary  for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometres (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished eco system that can be found nowhere else on earth.</p>

                <p>Glaciers that receded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city</p>
                            
                <p>This majestic park, minutes away and seen from our lakeshore, is awe-inspiring and completely peaceful with the incredible beauty of nature. Come experience the Algonquin grandeur, with all its fresh clean air, deep blue skies, rich green forests and hundreds of pristine lakes. It is impressive.</p>   
    
                <p>Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin's 7,630 square kilometres of  forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past.</p> 

                <p>Ontario's Algonquin Park and Area has more than 30 species of mammals, many are nocturnal or mostly subterranean and therefore not encountered. Listed are most commonly seen mammals, birds and reptiles in the Algonquin Park & Area.</p>   

                <p>Visit Algonquin and hear for the first and only time in your lives the mournful howl of a wolf? See firsthand — in Algonquin and nowhere else — a reasonable facsimile of the wilderness that once covered all of Ontario</p>

            <p>Spring offers the year's best Moose viewing and you typically don't have to search very hard to see Moose. The application of salt to Highway 60 during winter road maintenance operations, attracts Moose to roadside ditches. <br> We provide clothing to keep you warm and dry, includes 100% windproof & waterproof pants and jackets plus polar fleece interiors, if needed. We recommend that you bring good hiking shoes. <br>
             We provide free passes into Algonquin Park with your stay with us.(some exception during autumn).<br>
             Couples resort is located on the shores of Galeairy Lake, with direct access to Algonquin Park. Originally named Long lake which was renamed to Galeairy Lake because the lake borders Nightengale and Airy townships. <br> 
             Galeairy Lake is 11 kilometres (7 miles) long, land locked and extends mostly inside the boundaries of Algonquin Park . Explore the many secluded coves by canoe or kayak and search for loons, beaver, otter and moose. Pull up on shore, have a picnic and go for a swim.<br>
             Swimming in this lake is great. It is very clean and safe, with water temperatures hitting 25C (78F) by the end of July. Typically the lake temperature is above 18C (70F) from the third week of June to the first week of September.<br>

             From late April into May, a select group of wildflowers called “spring ephemerals” grow and bloom in the brief window between the spring snow melt and leaf-out of the overhead canopy of trees. Once the canopy has filled in, very little light reaches the forest floor and many of these wildflowers go into dormancy until the next year, staying alive as a rootstock underground.</p>

            <p>Spring is in the air and life in Nature is coming alive with excitement here at Algonquin Park...<br>
            Weather here in the spring can often be several degrees warmer than if you live near places like Lake Ontario as the ground here can warm up fast and we have no big Lake effect keeping air cool.<br>
            Whether you are a couple that wants to find that special time together uninterrupted or as a gift to someone special in your life, this experience will bring you closer together, and that is what life is all about.<br>
            The resort sits at the edge of a tiny Village, Whitney, and on a gorgeous Algonquin Park Lake, Galeairy Lake. This Lake is 11 km long, Semi-Private and 95% undeveloped so it is great for discovering hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the shorelines.</p>
